I am an Assistant Professor at [Florida Gulf Coast University](https://www.fgcu.edu/eng/). Before joining FGCU, I was a Research Assistant at the University of Missouri-Columbia and also worked with the Department of Energy at Argonne National Lab. I graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia in 2023 with a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of [Dr. Prasad Calyam](https://www.prasadcalyam.com/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (China) in 2016.

I currently serve as the Director of the FGCU EagleCyberNest Cybersecurity Research Lab and as the Faculty Advisor for the FGCU Cybersecurity Club. I also serve as an Executive Committee Chair at DENDRITIC (Human-Centered AI and Data Science) Institute. My work primarily focuses on Cybersecurity, Edge/Cloud Computing, Reinforcement Learning, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and Human-Centered Interaction, among other fields. As an Assistant Professor, I have successfully led teams of graduate, undergraduate, and visiting scholars on various Federal, State, and University-funded projects. My research has also involved collaborations with institutions such as the University of Florida, University of Missouri, U‑Mass Amherst, RENCI, USC ISI, Purdue, the University of Chicago, University at Buffalo SUNY, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Université de Paris, Ritsumeikan University, and Missouri S & T.

In addition to my research, I am actively involved in the academic community. I serve as a peer reviewer for several prominent international IEEE/ACM conferences and journals, contributing to the peer-review process for publications like TNSM, MobiSys, GlobeCOM, ICCCN, TMC, TSC, CIoT, ICC, JNCA, FGCS, and IM. My passion for education is reflected in my experience as a teaching assistant and lab instructor for four EECS courses and three IT courses. I am a dedicated member of the academic community and am proud to be an IEEE Student Member and a member of the IEEE Communication Society.

I have open positions for **graduate and undergraduate research assistants**; Please send me an email (only if you have already been admitted to FGCU) with your resume and a convincing statement of interest.
